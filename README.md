# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Description
Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, affecting millions of individuals each year. Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is pivotal for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. In this era of advanced technology and data-driven healthcare, machine learning offers a promising solution to assist medical professionals in the timely and precise identification of breast cancer cases.

This project aims to create a predictive model that accurately classifies breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we developed a reliable tool to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Develop a predictive model for breast cancer classification.
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Use data preprocessing techniques like scaling, PCA, and exploratory data analysis to improve model performance.

## Steps Implemented
1. **Convert Diagnosis Data to Numerical**: Converted categorical diagnosis labels to numerical values for processing.
2. **Standard Scaling**: Scaled the features to ensure consistent ranges and improve model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between features.
4. **Outlier Detection**: Identified and handled outliers to improve model robustness.
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduced dimensionality to enhance computational efficiency and reduce noise.
6. **Modeling**: Implemented various machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer cases.

## Models and Results
The following machine learning models were evaluated on the dataset:

### Logistic Regression
- **Accuracy**: 0.9883
- **Precision**: 0.9841
- **Recall**: 0.9841

### Decision Tree
- **Accuracy**: 0.9298
- **Precision**: 0.8923
- **Recall**: 0.9206

### Random Forest
- **Accuracy**: 0.9532
- **Precision**: 0.9365
- **Recall**: 0.9365

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Accuracy**: 0.9708
- **Precision**: 0.9531
- **Recall**: 0.9683

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Accuracy**: 0.9591
- **Precision**: 0.9516
- **Recall**: 0.9365

### Summary of Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness. High accuracy indicates the model's effectiveness but may not be sufficient for imbalanced datasets.
- **Precision**: Ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions. High precision reduces false positives, which is critical in medical diagnosis.
- **Recall**: Ratio of true positive predictions to total actual positives. High recall minimizes false negatives, crucial for life-threatening diagnoses.

## Cross-Validation Results
To assess model performance across different data subsets, cross-validation was performed:
- **Mean Accuracy**: 0.9772
- **Standard Deviation**: 0.0119

This indicates that the model performs consistently and reliably across various data splits.

## Conclusion
The logistic regression model exhibits exceptional diagnostic capabilities for breast cancer classification:
- **High Accuracy**: 98.83%
- **High Precision**: 98.41%
- **High Recall**: 98.41%

These metrics, combined with the model's interpretability, make it a valuable tool for aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. Its balanced combination of precision and recall ensures minimal false positives and false negatives, making it a reliable diagnostic tool.
