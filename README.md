# Breast Cancer Classification using Logistic Regression

## Description
Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, affecting millions of individuals each year. Early and accurate diagnosis is pivotal for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. In this era of advanced technology and data-driven healthcare, machine learning offers a promising solution to assist medical professionals in the timely and precise identification of breast cancer cases.

This project leverages machine learning to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on historical data and relevant features. Using logistic regression, the model demonstrates high accuracy, precision, and recall, making it a reliable tool for aiding medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
